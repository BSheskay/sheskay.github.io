This is a site I build with gh-pages. **Wow**. Not really though, I just slightly edited the file I was supposed to use.

It reads [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and turns it into html.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BSheskay/sheskay.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
